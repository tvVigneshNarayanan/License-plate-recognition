License Plate Recognition
Problem Statement
Detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates is a challenging task that involves two distinct datasets:

Vehicle Image Dataset

Contains 900 vehicle images sourced from the internet.
Each image is meticulously annotated with precise bounding box coordinates around the license plates.
License Plate Image Dataset

Consists of 900 images of license plates.
Annotations for this dataset are alphanumeric text labels representing the characters on each license plate.
Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:

License Plate Detection:

Identify and locate license plates affixed to vehicles in the images.
Utilize the bounding box annotations to accurately pinpoint the position of each license plate.
Character Recognition:

Perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the detected license plates.
Extract and decipher the alphanumeric text from each license plate image.
